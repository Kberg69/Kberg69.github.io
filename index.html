    <h2> ðŸ“Ÿ About Me ðŸ’¾ </h2>
    <ul>
    <p> As someone who has always been passionate about both technology and community service, I am excited to be pursuing my
    Bachelor of Science in Cloud Computing through the AWS Educate program at Western Governors University. Growing up in
    Queens, New York, I've seen firsthand the positive impact that technology can have on underserved communities, and I am
    eager to use my skills to make a difference in my own community.
    One of my biggest motivations for pursuing a career in cloud computing is the flexibility it offers. I am someone who
    values my time with family and friends, and the ability to work remotely and travel while still making a meaningful
    impact in my field is something that resonates with me personally. </p>
    <!--break-->
    <p>In my free time, I love to stay active by jogging and working out, and I also enjoy reading and teaching computer
    classes for senior citizens in my community. These experiences have not only helped me to stay sharp and learn new
    skills, but it has also allowed me to give back to my community.Am a big fan of shows like Game of Thrones and Stranger Things, and I find inspiration in books such as How to Lie
    with Statistics, The 48 Laws of Power, and A Song of Ice and Fire.All in all, I am excited to bring my unique background and experiences to the field of cloud computing and I am looking
    forward to making a meaningful impact in my community, while also being able to continue to grow personally and
    professionally.</P></ul>
